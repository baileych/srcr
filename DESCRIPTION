Description: Connecting to databases requires boilerplate code to specify
    connection parameters and to set up sessions properly with the DBMS.
    This package provides a simple tool to fill two purposes: abstracting
    connection details, including secret credentials, out of your source
    code and managing configuration for frequently-used database connections
    in a persistent and flexible way, while minimizing requirements on the
    runtime environment.
